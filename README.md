# Unhandled Errors in Asynchronous Express.js Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled errors in asynchronous operations within route handlers.  Asynchronous operations (like database queries or API calls) are often used within routes to fetch data.  However, if these operations fail and the error isn't properly handled, your application may silently fail, or worse, return unexpected responses to clients.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of this error. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to correctly handle these errors using appropriate error-handling mechanisms such as try...catch blocks or async/await with error handling.
